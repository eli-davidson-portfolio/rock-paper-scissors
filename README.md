### Developer Note
Dear User,
My key focus for this project changed during development. What started as a project I knew I had the skill to complete without much effort, became an exploration in user UX that stretched my skill set, and patience beyond its limit.
Because I had not clarified all requirements before starting, I did not plan for the user to be able to change their playable token until mid-project. When considering how a user should be able to choose their token, as a non-binary, person of color, I was faced with the reality that I could not easily choose myself in the game, unless the ability to customize became much more complex.
The result was the user was able to choose from 54 character combinations, set their name, and choose the application theme colors.
I cannot put into words the amount of work this took, or the attention to detail included. Although I would do things quite differently in the future, this experience was invaluable to my development as an empathetic software engineer.
Stretching past the project spec, I not only learned all about emoji combinations, but I also learned some things about accessibility; how color palettes affect the user's ability to read text, or see buttons. I learned about font weights, shadows, word choice, and animation timing. Corners were cut, and plans changed several times, but I am quite proud to have focused on the user's experience.
I made this for you, and I sincerely hope you enjoy it.
