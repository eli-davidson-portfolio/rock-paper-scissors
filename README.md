# Rock, Paper, Scissors.
## Overview
"Rock Paper Scissors" is a playable, single page web game built using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. 

### Project Spec
The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo.html). 

## Learning Goals
1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    * DRY JavaScript
    * event delegation to handle similar event listeners
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to a logical challenge
## Developer note
Dear User,

My key focus for this project changed during development. What started as a project I knew I had the skill to complete without much effort, became an exploration in user UX that streached my skillset, and patience beyond it's limit. 

Because I had not clearified all requirements before starting, I did not plan for the user to be able to change their playable token until mid-project. When considering how a user should be able to choose their token, as a non-binary, person of color, I was faced with the reality that I could not easily choose myself in the game, unless the ability to customize became much more complex.

The result was the user to be able to choose from 54 charactor combonations, set their name, and choose the application theme colors.

I cannot put into words the amount of work this took, or the attention to detail included. Although I would do things quite differently in the future, this experiance was invalueable to my development as an empathetic software engineer. 

Streaching past the project spec, I not only learned all about emoji combonations, but I also learned some things about accessability; how color palettes affect the users ability to read text, or see buttons. I learned about font weights, shadows, word choice, and animation timing. Corners were cut, and plans changed several times, but I am quite proud to have focused on the users experiance.

I made this for you, and I sincerly hope you enjoy it.
